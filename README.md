## Work Day Scheduler

In this project, I attempted to create a workday planner that would color-code past, present, and future hours using moment.js. Additionally, we were tasked with saving the text input from the text boxes in each row so that the user will be able to save any events they may have at a given time. I was unfortunately not able to get as far in this project as I wanted, but the website has been formatted and the text boxes and buttons are functional.

## Issues

1. The jQuery CDN in the base code had to be moved two lines down because the console kept declaring "\$" as undefined. None of my jQuery code worked until the CDN was moved down.
2. The Current Weekday is not dynamic.
3. The textbox background colors are not working for an unknown reason. Even when the current time is hardcoded.
